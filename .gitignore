# Note on MLflow, data, and models for deployment:
# The Streamlit application (src/frontend/app.py) currently loads:
# - The MLmodel from the 'mlruns' directory.
# - 'data/processed/team_stats.csv'.
# - 'models/scaler_mean.npy' and 'models/scaler_scale.npy'.
#
# Ensure these files and the 'mlruns' directory (or at least the specific
# MLflow run artifacts required by the application) are tracked by Git and
# included in your deployment package.
# If 'mlruns' becomes very large, consider a strategy to package
# only the necessary model artifacts (e.g., copy the specific model.pkl
# and related files to the 'models/' directory and adjust loading logic).
#
# The following should NOT be ignored if they are essential for the app:
# !data/processed/team_stats.csv
# !models/scaler_mean.npy
# !models/scaler_scale.npy
# mlruns/  <- Crucial for current app logic. Do not ignore unless model loading is changed.
